# Introduction

This package holds functions to work on the [llrs/TRIM](https://github.com/llrs/TRIM) analysis. 
The package helps to perform normalization of the metadata, repeated tasks for biological enrichment, correlations, or other steps I tried several times.  

The most useful functions are also distributed on the [llrs/inteRmodel](https://github.com/llrs/interModel) package. If you want to use the RGCCA methods use that (inteRmodel) package. 

This package barely use test, or good coding practices.
